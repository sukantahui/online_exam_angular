    <h3 class="text-dark"><b>What is Python?</b></h3>
    Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
    <br>
    It is used for:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>web development (server-side),</li>
        <li>software development,</li>
        <li>mathematics,</li>
        <li>system scripting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-dark"><b>What can Python do?</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
        <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-dark"><b>Why Python?</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
        <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-dark"><b>Good to know</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. <br>However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still <br>quite popular.</li>
        <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated <br>Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly <br>useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-dark"><b>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence <br>from mathematics.</li>
        <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which <br>often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
        <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, <br>functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
    </ul>
